# Budgets

As applications grow in functionality, they also grow in size. Budgets is a feature in the
Angular CLI which allows you to set budget thresholds in your configuration to ensure parts
of your application stay within boundries which you set.

**.angular-cli.json**
```
{
  ...
  apps: [
    {
      ...
      budgets: []
    }
  ]
}
```
